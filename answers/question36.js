//What is a loop in JavaScript, and why do we use it?

//A loop in JavaScript is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition.
// Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks, iterate over collections (like arrays or objects), and perform actions multiple times without having to write the same code repeatedly.
// They help in reducing code redundancy and improving efficiency.
