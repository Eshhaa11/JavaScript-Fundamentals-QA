//What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

//For Loop: A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. 
//It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

//and

//While Loop: A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition. 
//The loop continues as long as the condition evaluates to true.
