//1. What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript?

//The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
//It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each node corresponds to a part of the document (such as elements, attributes, and text).
// The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically.
