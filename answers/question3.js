//What are variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them?
 
//Variables are like containers which are used to store data values
//We have 3 ways in which we can declare them
  //1) var
  //2) let
  //3) const    
    
//In Var and Let, you can re-assign the value but for Const you cannot.

//Examples
  //var:
      //var name = "Esha";
      //name = "Kripa";

  //let:
      //let age = 18;
     //age = 19;

  //const:
   // const city = "New York";
   // city = "Los Angeles";      

     //(This will throw an error since in const the values cannot be re-assign)
