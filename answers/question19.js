//Explain the concept of scope in JavaScript.
//Scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of the code.
// There are two main types of scope:

//Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
//Local Scope: Variables declared within a function or block are in the local scope and can only be accessed within that function or block.
