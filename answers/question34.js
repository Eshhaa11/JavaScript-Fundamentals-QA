//How do you add a new key-value pair to an existing object?

//You can add a new key-value pair to an existing object in JavaScript using either dot notation or bracket notation. 
//Dot notation is straightforward and is used when the key is a valid identifier.

//Bracket notation is useful when the key is not a valid identifier or when the key is stored in a variable.
