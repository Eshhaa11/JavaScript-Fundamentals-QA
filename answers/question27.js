//What is the difference between innerHTML and textContent?
 
//innerHTML: This property allows you to get or set the HTML content of an element.
// It can include HTML tags, which will be parsed and rendered as HTML.

//textContent: This property allows you to get or set the text content of an element.
// It does not parse HTML tags; it treats them as plain text.
