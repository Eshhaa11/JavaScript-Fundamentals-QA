//Write a JavaScript expression that evaluates whether a number is both greater than 10 and less than 20.

let num = 12; 
let isBetween = num > 10 && num < 20; 
console.log(isBetween); 

//In this expression, num > 10 checks if num is greater than 10, and num < 20 checks if num is less than 20. The && operator make sure that both conditions must be true for the isBetween to be true.
