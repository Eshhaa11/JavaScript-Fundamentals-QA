//1. What is a function in JavaScript, and how do you define one?
//A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are reusable pieces of code that can take inputs (arguments), perform operations, and return a value.

//You can define a function using the function keyword followed by a name, parentheses for parameters, and curly braces for the function body.

//Example

function greet(person) {
    return "Hi, " + person + "!";
}
