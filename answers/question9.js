//Explain what NaN means in JavaScript.

//NaN stands for "Not-a-Number."
// It is a special value in JavaScript that represents an undefined or unrepresentable numerical result, particularly in the floating-point calculations. 
//NaN is the result of operations that do not yield a valid number, such as dividing zero by zero or attempting to analyze a non-numeric string as a number.
