//What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?

//Function Declarations - These are defined using the function keyword followed by the function name. They can be called before they are defined in the code.

//Function Expressions: These are defined by assigning a function to a variable. They are not hoisted, so you cannot call them before they are defined.
